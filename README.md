# BLOOD BANK APPLICATION


This project is made by me as a university project. I was a C# guy but seeing the usefulness of javascript i wanted to get into javascript with the eventual goal of becoming a MERN stack developer. This project gave me a proper launcing pad for getting into javascript from C#.

## Motivation


Learning a new language especially when you are shifting from one of your favourite language (C# in my case) can be tough. Now in a university project, one has to deliver the application by hook or by crooks, so i thought that when the pressure would be on me maybe i will learn the MERN stack quicker than normal and in an application like Blood Bank i would learn a lot of new things along the way which is exactly what happen and hence this application is made
